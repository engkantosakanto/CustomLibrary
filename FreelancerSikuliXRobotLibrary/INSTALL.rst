FreelancerSikuliXRobotLibrary Installation
=============================


Preconditions
-------------

FreelancerSikuliXRobotLibrary supports Jython interpreters supported by the
Robot Framework.

FreelancerSikuliXRobotLibrary depends on a few other Jython libraries, including
of course Robot Framework. All dependencies are declared in setup.py.

SikuliX must be installed with the Tesseract based OCR features. When running the sikulixsetup-1.1.0.jar,
make sure to select the second and third options.


Installing from source
----------------------

The source code can be retrieved either as a source distribution or as a clone
of the main source repository. The installer requires Jython version 2.7 or
newer. Install by running::

    jython setup.py install

Note: In most linux systems, you need to have root privileges for installation.

Uninstallation is achieved by deleting the installation directory and its
contents from the file system. The default installation directory is
`[JythonLibraries]/site-packages/robotframework_freelancersikulixrobotlibrary-1.0.0-py2.7.egg`.


Verifying Installation
----------------------

Once you have installed FreelancerSikuliXRobotLibrary it is a good idea to verify the installation. To verify installation start jython::

     C:\> jython

and then at the Python prompt type::

	>> import FreelancerSikuliXRobotLibrary
	>>

If the python command line interpretor returns with another prompt ('>>' as shown above) then your installation was successful.

Troubleshooting Installation
----------------------------

The most common issue with installing FreelancerSikuliXRobotLibrary is missing dependencies. An error like::

    ImportError: No module named sikuli

indicates that you are missing the sikulixapi.jar package.  To correct this problem, install the sikulixapi.jar with tesseract
then ann the following in the environment variables::

	  CLASSPATH = <path to sikulixapi.jar>
      JYTHONPATH = <path to sikulixapi.jar>\Lib

Similarly if you receive "No module named ..." error message then you have another missing dependency.  To correct, use easy_install to install the missing package.
