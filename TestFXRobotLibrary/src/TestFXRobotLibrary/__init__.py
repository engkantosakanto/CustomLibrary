    """TestFXRobotLibrary is a ``gui recognition`` testing library for Robot Framework that leverages the ``SikuliX version 1.1.0`` methods 
    to control matching ``PSMRL`` (pattern, string, match, region or location).
    See http://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html for more information on SikuliX.
    It should work in most modern OS.

    = Before running tests =
    The following must be installed:
    | `Java`           | # Version 6, 7 or 8 (preferably 7, version 6 is deprecated) |
    | `Jython`         | # Version 2.7.0                                             |
    | `robotframework` | # Installed via `jython setup.py install` (jybot must be setup in the environment variable) |
    | `SikuliX` v1.1.0 | # The sikuli script (sikulixapi.jar) must be installed together with the Tesseract based OCR features in order to read texts on screen. The Settings.OcrTextSearch and Settings.OcrTextRead must be set to True. see http://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) |

    *Set the Environment Variables*
    The following must be included in the environment variables:
    | `CLASSPATH` = <sikulixapi.jar's directory>      | # Must be setup in the environment variable in the test PC or Node |
    | `JYTHONPATH` = <sikulixapi.jar's directory>/Lib | # Must be setup in the environment variable in the test PC or Node |

    = Installing the TestFXRobotLibrary =
    | 1. Copy the ``TestFXRobotLibrary`` to a local directory.                | 
    | 2. cd to the TestFXRobotLibrary where ``setup.py`` is located           |
    | 3. Open a terminal or command prompt then install via ``jython setup.py install``. |

    = Verify Installation =
    Once you have installed TestFXRobotLibrary it is a good idea to verify the installation. To verify installation start jython and then at the Jython prompt type:

    >>> import TestFXRobotLibrary
    >>>

    If the jython command line interpreter returns with another prompt ('>>>' as shown above) then your installation was successful.

    = Locating or specifying elements =
    All keywords in TestFXRobotLibrary that need to find a ``pattern`` or any of the PSMRL on the screen take an argument that serves as the `locator` (for more information about ``PSMRL``, see http://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) . 
    `locator` is a string that describes how to locate an element 
    using a syntax specifying a pattern to search for in a screen, which is a representation of the element.

    PNG format must be used for reference patterns for better image resolution and better image detection.

    *Using locators*
    By default, when a ``locator`` value is provided, it is checked if a png with image sensitivity otherwise,
    it is treated as a string. When a locator is a string, the ``OCR`` (Optical Character Recognition) setting must be set to `True`.

    For example:
    | *Keywords*     | *Locators or PSMRL* | *Description*                                                                              |
    | Click Pattern  |  pattern.png = 0.90 | # Locator is a PNG image format with image sensitivity set to 0.90                         |
    | Click Pattern  |  pattern.png        | # Locator is a PNG image format with image sensitivity set to the default value 0.70.      |
    | Click Pattern  |  Password           | # Locator as a string or non-PNG images are matched against any string or image on screen. |

        """TestFXRobotLibrary can be imported with optional arguments.

        `sikulix_timeout` is the default timeout used to wait for all waiting actions.
        Default `sikulix_timeout` value is 3 seconds. It can be later set with `Set SikuliX Timeout`.

        `sikulix_scanrate` is the default search rate for the given Visual rate times per second
        until `pattern` is found or the `timeout` is reached. Default `sikulix_scanrate` value is 3.
        It can be later set with `Set SikuliX Scanrate`.

        `target_screen` is the default screen for multi-monitor environments. For more information on multi-monitor environments,
        see https://sikulix-2014.readthedocs.org/en/latest/screen.html

        `run_on_failure` specifies the name of a keyword (from any available
        libraries) to execute when a TestFXRobotLibrary keyword fails. By default
        `Capture Screenshot Of Active App` will be used to take a screenshot of the Active
        application in focus. Using the value "Nothing" will disable this feature altogether. 
        See `Register Keyword To Run On Failure` keyword for more information about this
        functionality.

        `screenshot_root_directory` specifies the default root directory that screenshots should be
        stored in. If not provided the default directory will be where robotframework places its logfile.

        Examples:

        | Library `|` TestFXRobotLibrary `|` 5 `|` run_on_failure=Capture Screenshot Of Active App | # Sets default timeout to 5 seconds and runs `Log Source` on failure                  |
